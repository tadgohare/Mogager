# Mogager

This is a fitness management tool used for fitness clubs to cater to the many diverse needs of clients, trainers, and other fitness staff. This application is for my database management class (COMP 3005 at Carleton University), and utilises PostgreSQL, and uses React for frontend and Rust for the server side code.
The word Mogager comes from the word mog, which is to have a strong physical presence which towers over others ultimately, being the best version of yourself.
